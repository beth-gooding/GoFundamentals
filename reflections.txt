Chapter 2
 - Like that the fmt.Println automatically adds spaces between arguments
 - switch statements automatically break rather than fallthrough

Chapter 3
 - runes are confusing, need to read more about them

 Chapter 4
- slices are built on top of arrays which means you need to understand how it works underneath

Chapter 5
- Interesting how using camelCase for a function name means it can't be exported outside of that package
- Exercise 5.06 says you're going to calculate the square root, but it actually calculates the square
- Closures are complicated, but cover 5.07 again and see if you can get your head around exactly how it works
- Definitely need to come back and discuss with team again about how closures work, something isn't clicking yet.

Chapter 6
- Error handling is different but I don't see what's so annoying about it how it's often mentioned

Chapter 10
- If you want to export a function, method etc, it needs to start with a capital letter
- Lower case starting letter = no export
- No access modifiers like Java

Chapter 13
- Exercise 13.03 has something wrong with it, because the last line of my file is not being processed (try to spot the cause)
- Even running the code from GitHub still does the same thing, so there must be something inherently wrong
